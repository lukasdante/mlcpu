# Pure C++ CPU-based Classical Machine Learning Library

I have one class in classical machine learning in my university. I am currently learning C++ so the library may not be computationally profound but it is mathematically rigorous. Scalarhis is just a small project I created to bridge all the things I learned in C++ (which I'm not yet done learning).

## WIP
Everything you see here is a work-in-progress, I'm just trying to have fun. I didn't ask any LLMs like ChatGPScalar to code the logic, calculations, etc. but I asked it to teach me C++ and mathematics behind machine learning such as calculating the gradient for loss functions or how to throw custom errors.

## Future
I would probably create another library that uses CUDA. I just can't get my hands on one right now because my laptop doesn't have CUDA-accelerated GPU.
